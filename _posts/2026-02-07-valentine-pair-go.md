### Bio:

#### Kuranosukeb (Japan):

Go player / Streamer – Fox 7–8 dan

I play both competitively and casually, and I also give Go lessons. I consider myself an enjoy-style player who values both improvement and fun, and I look forward to playing and sharing great games together!

From time to time, I organize a community tournament called “Kura Cup” with streamers and friends from around the world, where all matches are streamed live.

I hope to host it again in the future — please look forward to it!

#### SoumyaK4 (India):

SoumyaK4 is a lifelong student and teacher of Martial Arts and Go — in his words, “Martial Arts for Body & Brain.”
 
For nearly a decade, he’s taught Kung Fu & Filipino Martial Arts to hundreds.

He represented India in global Go events and is a mentor at AIGP.

As a player, developer & mentor, he runs Weiqi Roadmap & BadukTube, two projects that help players study Go in an organized way.

His twitch streams are mainly Tsumegos, Games & DDK reviews. 

His Motto: “If You GET, GIVE. If You LEARN, TEACH.”

#### Deep Baduk (Korea):

My dream is to establish a 'Yin-Yang Five Elements School' where people worldwide can learn the universal principles of Yin-Yang through engaging and enjoyable experiences. For me, this journey begins with Baduk. With 21 years of experience studying and teaching the wisdom of Baduk in Korea, I'd like to share my background:

- KBA official 6D, Tygem 9D
- KBF official Baduk Coach and Instructor
- Bachelor of Baduk study in Myongji University
- Studying for master of Oriental Culture  

Can Baduk awaken your soul in this moment? “A true Baduk master places stones not just on the board, but in the deep soul of learners.”

#### BadukBum (Philippines):

They call me Bum. My name's true to form: lazy in terms of studying. Nowadays, I just say I’m a Fox player – that's why you're gonna find me on Twitch, grinding tsumego and playing casual games. I don’t see myself as a competitive player since life’s gotten busier, but I enjoy creating Go-related art, organizing events, and teaching kids Go. I'm learning to balance mind and body, inspired by my running family. Hope we can keep this up for as long as possible!
