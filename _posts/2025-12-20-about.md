## Event

Hello Go players around the world, this event started because some of us, for whom finding someone to play or attend events offline was hard and we also wanted to celebrate New Year the Go Way.<br>
Everything started when our [Lead Organiser](#lead-organiser) began contacting us about his idea and within weeks we somehow managed to put together our test run with the [2026](/posts/2026) event.
